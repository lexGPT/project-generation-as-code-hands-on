# Project Generation as Code: Hands On

Prerequisites:
- NodeJS >=18


## Part 1: Creating a Project
To start creating a project run `npx projen new` in your terminal. This will print all the available options including the default project types that are included in Projen.

> As you can see in the list Projen included project types for other languages then typescript as well. You can even create them from using the `npx projen new` command and then continue in that language.

For the purpose of this hands on lets create a AWS CDK typescript app by running the command `npx projen new awscdk-app-ts`. After initiating the command projen will start populating your directory with all the necessary files.

You will probably recognise a lot of them as they are used in tools you are already familiar with. One file you are probably not familiar with is the `.projenrc.ts` file. This is the configuration file that you will use to further configure the project in the next part of the hands on.
